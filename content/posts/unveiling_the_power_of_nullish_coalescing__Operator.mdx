So, while working on one of my projects , I got a typescript linting error that said 
"__prefer-nullish-coalescing__"([additional info](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/prefer-nullish-coalescing.md)) for 
a location where I use || to eliminate a false value, And then my curiosity arose to deep dive into these operators 

Therefore in this post I will share part of my understanding, which is interesting, and afterÂ this you will have a better grasp of how these operators operate behind the scenes.

        <br />
## JavaScript Operators Reference
        <br />
| Operator        | Description                  | Example                           |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| &&            | Logical AND                   | true && false returns false   |
| \|\|            | Logical OR                    | true \|\| false returns true  |
| !             | Logical NOT                   | !true returns false           |
| ==            | Equality (loose equality)     | '5' == 5 returns true         |
| ===           | Strict Equality               | '5' === 5 returns false       |
| !=            | Inequality (loose inequality) | '5' != 5 returns false        |
| !==           | Strict Inequality             | '5' !== 5 returns true        |
| ??            | Nullish Coalescing            | null ?? 'Default' returns 'Default' |
| ?:            | Conditional (Ternary) Operator | condition ? trueExpr : falseExpr |
        <br />
        <br />

Among these logical operators, and two that often find themselves in the spotlight are the "?? (nullish coalescing)" and "|| (logical OR)" operators.
        <br />

When it comes to handling values in javascript the choice between the `??` (nullish coalescing) and `||` operators can significantly impact the behavior of your code
<br/>
lets's delve into the nuances of each operator to understand their distinctions and  use cases
        <br />
## Logical OR ('||') Operator 

 In simple terms it returns the first truthy value it encounters, or the last falsy value if none are truthy.
        <br />
 ```js

 const result = false || 'Default';

 /*
  Since the first operand (false) is falsy,
  it short-circuits and returns the second operand ('Default').
  Result: 'Default' 
  */
 ```

 <br />
 <br />
 these are the javascript's all `falsy` values for which the || short-circuits 
 <br />

| Falsy Value | Explanation                         |
|:------------ |:----------------------------------- |
| false      | Boolean false                       |
| 0          | Number zero                         |
| ''         | Empty string                        |
| null       | Null                                |
| undefined  | Undefined                           |
| NaN        | Not a Number                        |
 <br />
## Nullish Coalescing ('??') Operator

Its is same as the logical OR operator except that it only short-circuits for nullish values (null or undefined), but not for falsy values (null, undefined, 0, '', false, NaN).
        <br />
 ```js

 const result = false ?? 'Default';

 /*
  Since the first operand (false) is falsy,
  it does not short-circuit and returns the second operand (false).
  Result: false 
  */
 ```

 <br />
 <br />
 these are the javascript's all `nullish` values for which the ?? short-circuits 
 <br />

 | Nullish Value | Explanation                         |
 |:------------ |:----------------------------------- |
 | null      | Null                                |
 | undefined | Undefined                           |




 <br />
 <br />
 

## Why ?? is the Hero:
        <br />

`1`. __Precision with Falsy Values:__
        <br />

     The ?? operator allows for more precision when dealing with falsy values. This is particularly crucial in scenarios where `0` or an empty string should be considered valid.
        <br />
    ```js
     let value = 0;
     let result = value ?? 'Default'; // result will be 0
    ```

    <br />
`2`. __Avoiding Unintended Side Effects:__
    <br />
    Using || might lead to unintended consequences if the left operand can be a `valid falsy value`. The nullish coalescing operator helps
    developers write code that aligns with their intentions, reducing the chances of bugs related to unexpected falsy values.
    <br />
    ```js
     let count = 0;
     let totalCount = count || 10; // totalCount will be 10, potentially not what was intended
    ```

## When to Choose Which:    

While the ?? operator offers advantages in certain scenarios, it's essential to consider the context.

   <br />
`1`. __Use || When Handling Potentially Falsy Values:__

   <br />
   If you want to provide a default value for both nullish and falsy values, || might be more appropriate.

   <br />
`2`. __Use ?? When You Explicitly Want to Coalesce Nullish Values:__

   <br />
   If you want to differentiate between nullish and falsy values, and only want to coalesce when the value is null or undefined, ?? is the better choice.

## Conclusion:   

JavaScript's ?? and || operators each have their strengths, and understanding when to use each is crucial for writing clear, bug-free code. 
The nullish coalescing operator, with its precision and clarity, proves to be a valuable addition to a developer's toolkit, offering a more refined 
solution in certain scenarios. As always, choosing the right tool for the job depends on the specific requirements of your code.
