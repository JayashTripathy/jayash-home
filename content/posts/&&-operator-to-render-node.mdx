title: Avoid Using the && Operator for Conditional React Rendering

Its a very common practice among JS developers of using `&&` operator to render out components 
<br/>
```jsx 
export function App () {
    return(
        <>
            {items.length && <div> Hello World <div/>}
        </>
    )
}
```
<br/>
For most cases it will works but in some scenarios it can lead to major inconsistency in your code
<br/>
## Why Does This Happen?
The issue arises when `items.length is 0`. You might expect to render nothing due to the empty list, but it will display `0` instead.

## But WHY?
To understand why this happens lets look at quirky behavior of Javascript's && operator 

- It evaluates from left -> right
- If it encounters a falsy value (e.g. ->  `0`, `false` , `null`, `an empty string` or `NaN`) it stops and return that value
- If the left side is truthy, it proceeds to evaluate the right operand, and it will return the value on the right side, whether it is truthy or falsy.

## What's the Solution?

Use the condition `items.length > 0`  when the length is 0, it will `return false` and nothing will be rendered (since false evaluates to null) 
<br/>
```jsx 
export function App () {
    return(
        <>
            {items.length > 0 && <div> Hello World <div/>}
        </>
    )
}
```
<br/>
By making this simple adjustment, you can ensure consistent and predictable React rendering in your application.
