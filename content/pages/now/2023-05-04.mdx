## Life 🔆

My home is in Bhilai, Chattisgarh. Currently studying for a Btech in Information Technology at the [Bhilai Institute of Technology, Durg](https://bitdurg.ac.in/). In 2024, I will graduate.

## Work 💼

From the past 2 years, I have been working as a Web developer. I have worked for organizations like Google Developer Students Club BITD as a Web development lead, [OpInHacks](https://opinhacks.co) (a general-themed hackathon that will be held in Chhattisgarh).

In addition, prior to entering the tech industry, I worked as a graphic designer for leading institutions such as [TedX](https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/40245), PositivityXO, [Newton School](https://www.newtonschool.co/), and others.

We organized DurgFOSS this past March! Great learning experiences were had throughout the journey.

## Reading 📙

I have trouble finding the time to read, but when I do, I’m currently making my way through these books:

- Cant Hurt Me by David Goggins 🟩
- Steal Like an Artist by Austin Kleon ✅
