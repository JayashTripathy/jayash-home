## Internship 💼

Completed my 3 months front-end developer internship at [Writeroo](https://www.writeroo.net/) 
<br/>
Learned a lot of thing here 
- About Production-development workflows
- Got my first introduction to typescript (which, if you're into javascript development, is the best thing you should learn because it streamlines and simplifies the workflow),
- Got exposed to various tools and libraries used by the organization like i18nxt, tanstack-query, etc. 
- How to write scalable, clean code with taking into account end users and fellow developers 

In the end, working with the Writeroo team was a lot of thrilling for me and added a lot of value.
